# OpenPO
Open PO project

This project is designed to allow startup Companies use my code to build an Open POs platform for bidding.  The code uses entity framework, sql server, c#, web api, and angularjs with typescript to build the single page applications.  The framework will allow purchase orders to be uploaded, quotes on bids, and contracts to fullfill.
